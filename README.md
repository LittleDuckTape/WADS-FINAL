# Web Application Development and Security (COMP6703001) Final Project
<b>Tech Stack:</b>
<ul>
<li>Frontend: Next.js</li>
<li>Backend: Node.js</li>
<li>API: some sort of restful api</li>
<li>Database: PostgreSQL</li>
<li>Deployment: Docker</li>
</ul>
<h1><b>Architecture:</b></h1>
<p>For this project, our team has decided to implement a monolithic approach in terms of architecture. This is because a monolithic architecture would provide us with an easier time developing it since all of the code is in one container. Not only that, this would make it easier for us to debug as well, since errors can be more easily traced to their origin.</p>

<h1><b>Project Selection:</b></h1>
<p>For this project, we have selected to make a study planner and productivity tracker web application. The selected project would allow us to learn crucial new skills, such as system design, and hones existing ones front end development. Additionally, the project itself would be useful outside of the web application development scope, as it can be used in real life as well.</p>
